## about

Neatlogic-report is a report module that supports users to configure report data sources and filtering conditions based on their needs and scenarios. For example, using reports to summarize all work orders from the past month, the module comes with functions such as report templates, report management, sending plans and large screen management.

## Feature

### Report Template

Report templates are composed of condition configuration, data source configuration, and content configuration. In content configuration, the style of data source display can be defined, such as using tables, bar charts, pie charts, etc. Report templates provide convenience for scenarios with high reuse frequency and support limiting the scope of users through authorization.

### Large screen management
Large screen management can meet the needs of users for real-time data monitoring, decision-making, promotion, and display scenarios. The characteristics of large screens include rich and diverse styles, high freedom of data sources, real-time data updates, and multiple types of visualization components. The large screen editing page is divided into three areas: canvas area, component selection area, and configuration area.
